# GPS from ZIP
Automate the creation of a GIS enabled database. From a Google Form to MySQL. 

## Creating a Google Form
1. Log into Google Drive and create a form. To keep this simple for now, let's just request two things: a zip code and a travel distance.
2. Click on the 'responses' tab at the top. Then, click on the green icon labeled 'link to sheets.' Create a new sheet then open.
3. At the top, click on 'share.' Set the general access level to 'anyone with the link.'
4. Go back to the Form editor and click 'send' at the top right. Send the link to yourself and put in five entries. Make each one different.
